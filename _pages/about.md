Hi!  My name is Ran Liu.  Iâ€™m a scientist and problem-solver interested in using data and intelligent algorithms to facilitate education and positive social change at scale.

I have an extensive academic background working on data science (post-doctoral) and cognitive science (doctoral) research at Carnegie Mellon University.

Currently, I work at <a href="https://www.amiralearning.com/" target="blank">Amira Learning</a> on developing machine learning and neural network approaches to detecting and classifying miscues in children's speech as they learn to read out loud.
