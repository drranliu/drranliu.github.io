Hi!  My name is Ran Liu.  Iâ€™m a scientist and problem-solver interested in using data and intelligent algorithms to facilitate education and positive social change at scale.

I have an extensive academic background working on data science (post-doctoral) and cognitive science (doctoral) research at Carnegie Mellon University.

At <a href="https://www.amiralearning.com/" target="blank">Amira Learning</a>, I'm currently developing machine learning and deep neural network approaches to detecting and classifying miscues in children's speech as they learn to read out loud.
