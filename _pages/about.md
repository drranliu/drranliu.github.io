Hi! My name is Ran Liu. Iâ€™m an experienced data scientist and problem-solver interested in using data and intelligent algorithms to facilitate education and positive social change at scale. I have an academic background working on data science (post-doctoral) and cognitive science (doctoral) research at Carnegie Mellon University. Currently, I am the Chief Data Scientist at an education/career technology startup, where my work encompasses analytics, machine learning, and technical product management.
