Hi!  My name is Ran Liu.  Iâ€™m a scientist and problem-solver interested in using data and intelligent algorithms to facilitate education and positive social change at scale.

I have an extensive academic background working on data science (post-doctoral) and cognitive science (doctoral) research at Carnegie Mellon University.

Currently, I lead the data science team at a personalized education/career technology startup, where my work encompasses analytics, machine learning, data architecture, and technical product management.
